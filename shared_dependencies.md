1. **Exported Variables**: None, as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do not have a traditional export/import system like other programming languages. However, global variables in JavaScript, such as `gameState` (to track the current state of the game) and `currentPlayer` (to track whose turn it is), can be considered shared as they will be accessed and manipulated across different functions.

2. **Data Schemas**: The game state can be represented as a 3x3 matrix or array of arrays in JavaScript. Each inner array represents a row in the Tic Tac Toe board, and each element in the inner array represents a cell, which can be 'X', 'O', or null (if the cell is empty).

3. **DOM Element IDs**: 
   - `board`: The main game board.
   - `cell-<index>`: Each cell on the game board, where `<index>` is a number from 0 to 8.
   - `message`: A place to display messages to the user, such as "It's Player X's turn" or "Player O wins!".
   - `reset-button`: A button to reset the game.

4. **Message Names**: 
   - `turnMessage`: A message indicating whose turn it is.
   - `winMessage`: A message indicating who won the game.
   - `drawMessage`: A message indicating that the game is a draw.

5. **Function Names**: 
   - `initializeGame`: A function to set up the game.
   - `handleClick`: A function to handle a click on a cell.
   - `checkWin`: A function to check if a player has won.
   - `checkDraw`: A function to check if the game is a draw.
   - `resetGame`: A function to reset the game.
   - `updateMessage`: A function to update the message displayed to the user.
